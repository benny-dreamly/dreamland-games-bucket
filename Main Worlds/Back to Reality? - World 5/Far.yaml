  goal:

    # Chaos Emerald Hunt (1): You have to collect all 7 Chaos Emeralds to unlock the Perfect Chaos Fight.
    #     There won't be any emblems in the item pool, only filler items and traps depending on your options
    # Emblems and Chaos Emerald Hunt (2): You have to collect both emblems and the emeralds to fight Perfect Chaos.
    # 
    # Keep in mind select emerald hunt will require enough checks to add the 7 emeralds to the pool,
