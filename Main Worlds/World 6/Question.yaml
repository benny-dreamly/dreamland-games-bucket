  # Game Options
  progression_balancing: normal
  accessibility: items

  enable_move_randomizer:
    # Enable to include movement options as items in the randomizer. Until you find his other moves, Jak is limited to
    # running, swimming, single-jumping, and shooting yellow eco through his goggles.
    # 
    # This adds 11 items to the pool.
    'false': 50
    'true': 0

  enable_orbsanity:
    # Enable to include bundles of Precursor Orbs as an ordered list of progressive checks. Every time you collect the
    # chosen number of orbs, you will trigger the next release in the list.
    # 
    # "Per Level" means these lists are generated and populated for each level in the game. "Global" means there
    # is only one list for the entire game.
    # 
    # This adds a number of Items and Locations to the pool inversely proportional to the size of the bundle.
    # For example, if your bundle size is 20 orbs, you will add 100 items to the pool. If your bundle size is 250 orbs,
    # you will add 8 items to the pool.
