  accessibility:
    # Set rules for reachability of your items/locations.
    # Locations: ensure everything can be reached and acquired.
    # Items: ensure all logically relevant items can be acquired.
    # Minimal: ensure what is needed to reach your goal can be acquired.
    locations: 100
    items: 0
    minimal: 0

  # Opens up beach entrance right away, and allows you to access areas you would
  #   normally need to get to rabi ribi town first to access
  open_mode: True

  # Randomize the hammar
  randomize_hammer: True

  # If set to False, carrot shooter will not be required to bomb locations.
  # These locations will be locked behind carrot bomb instead.
  carrot_shooter_in_logic: false

  # If set to true, the randomizer logic will attempt to place eggs in later spheres
  # resulting in harder to get to eggs.
  encourage_eggs_in_late_spheres: False

  # Knowledge can be BASIC, INTERMEDIATE or ADVANCED.
  # There are many tricks in the game that requires advanced knowledge of how the game works to perform.

  # - Basic is recommended for anyone not familiar with speedrunning tricks used in Rabi-Ribi.
  # - Intermediate is recommended for players who are already very familiar with the advanced speedrunning tricks used in Rabi-Ribi.
  # - Advanced tricks require extremely specific knowledge, and is not recommended unless you are always keeping up to date with the very specific tricks used to get into certain areas in the game.
  knowledge: "Basic" # Basic, Intermediate, Advanced

  # Difficulty can be NORMAL, HARD, V_HARD or STUPID.
  # Some tricks in Rabi-Ribi can be very difficult to execute. This flag determines the minimum execution ability required to complete the seed.

  # - Normal is recommended for most players. There are many tight jumps which are still labeled as NORMAL.
  # - Hard involves some tricks that are very tight, and can be difficult to execute even for experienced players. However, these tricks are still reasonable.
  # - V_Hard involves tricks that can be quite unreasonable to be expected to execute (i.e. borderline stupid), but some people still do them anyway.
  # - Stupid refers to tricks that no one wants to do, ever. This often refers to tricks that have only been performed successfully once, just to prove that it is possible.
  trick_difficulty: "Normal" # Normal, Hard, V_Hard, Stupid

  # Block clips are performed by quick-dropping onto the top of a one-tile block to obtain the item inside the block.
  #   Turning off this flag removes the need for block clips.
  block_clips_required: False

  # Semisolid Clips refers to clipping through semisolid
  #   (one-way) platforms via a specific glitch. If this flag is turned on,
  #   reaching some of the items may require semisolid clips to be performed.
  #   If turned off, all the required items can be obtained without the need
  #   for semisolid clips.
  semi_solid_clips_required: False

  # Zips are glitches that allow you to clip through terrain.
  #   The main types of zips are slide zips and hammer roll zips.
  #   If this flag is turned on, reaching some of the items may require
  #   zips to be performed. If turned off, all the required items can be
  #   obtained without the need for zips.
  zips_required: False

  # If this flag is true, the game might expect you to go into dark areas,
  #   even if you don’t have the Light Orb.
  darkness_without_light_orb: False

  # If this flag is true, the game might expect you to go into underwater areas,
  #   even if you don’t have the Water Orb.
  underwater_without_water_orb: False

  # Normal attack mode starts you with 0 attack ups.
  # Super attack mode starts you with 20 attack ups.
  # Hyper attack mode starts you with 30 attack ups.

  # This gives you a lot more damage, which is especially useful because you often don’t get
  # the hammer early in randomizer games. (Ribbon does about 20 damage per shot in super attack mode)
  attack_mode: "Normal" # Normal, Super, Hyper
