    # Toggles challenges as checks. This will add the first 14 challenge pages to the item pool representing each
    # page on the Challenges menu. Some levels can be completed through challenges without their respective
    # Stage Key. Page 15, the Insane Challenges are a separate toggle. Lastly, turning this on will add 20 more

    # Toggles the 15th and final page of the Challenge menu as an item and checks. These challenges are

    # Inspired by the bonus stages present in Peggle Dual Shot on the Nintendo DS. When enabled, hitting 5 purple
    # pegs on a level in a single attempt is a check. This is the equivalent of accessing the bonus stage in
    # Dual Shot. Additionally, 25 Certificates of Mastery are added to the pool, adding 20 to the 80% goal.

    # Enables checks for completing a level WITHOUT hitting any purple pegs. Enabling this is only recommended if
    # you are a true Peggle master, as this is quite a difficult task. Additionally, 25 Certificates of Mastery
    # are added to the pool, adding 20 to the 80% goal. This does not apply to Stage 11.

    # Enables checks for the bonus holes in Extreme Fever at the end of each level. Landing in a higher value holes
    # counts as that specific value as well as lower scoring values at the same time. (i.e. landing in the 50k
    # hole in 1-1 counts as 1-1's 10k and 50k fever checks, but not the 100k check) Additionally, 30 Certificates
    # of Mastery are added to the pool, adding 24 to the 80% goal. This does not apply to Stage 11.

    # When enabled, every orange peg in every level becomes a check, including levels in Stage 11. Additionally
    # every level's 25 Orange Pegs are spread out into the multiworld. You must obtain all 25 orange pegs for a
    # given level to be able to logically check the following locations:
    #    - Level Complete
    #    - Full Clear (Stages 1-10 only)
    #    - No Purples (Stages 1-10 only)
    #
    # In challenges that add more orange pegs, it's recommended to only count hit orange pegs as checks once the
    # Fever Meter begins to light up. However if you feel like manually counting, you can just have the checks
    # be the first 25 of however many orange pegs there are in the challenge.
    #
    # NOTE: Be wary that this adds 1,375 checks/progression items to your game. If you're looking for a short
    # game, please avoid this setting.
